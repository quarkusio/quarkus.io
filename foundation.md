Quarkus is in the process of joining the https://commonhaus.org[Commonhaus Foundation], a vendor-neutral foundation that will provide a home for the Quarkus project. The foundation will be a place where the community can collaborate on the future of Quarkus, and where the project can grow and evolve in a vendor-neutral way.
