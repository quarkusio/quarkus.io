With the recent announcement that Quarkus 1.0 is now available,
and after a tremendous effort from all the contributors and community,
we’re also excited to announce that Quarkus 1.0 is Eclipse MicroProfile 3.2 compatible!
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/releases/microprofile-3.2[MicroProfile 3.2] was released this week,
bringing updates to the Metrics and Health specifications,
but what is MicroProfile and why do I care?
https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] creates specifications for developing microservices with Enterprise Java,
making compatibility with MicroProfile a key feature of Quarkus.

Over the last couple of months,
the team has worked tirelessly to add the various MicroProfile specification TCKs to the Quarkus build and hunt down the failures they raised.
With fixes not just in Quarkus,
but also fixes for dependent libraries such as https://smallrye.io/[SmallRye] and https://resteasy.github.io/[RESTEasy].

With Quarkus we’re seeking the best developer experience for cloud-native development,
and sometimes that means making tough decisions.
With ArC we sought to create an opinionated CDI implementation optimized for the cloud and containers, and in particular, Kubernetes.
ArC isn’t a full CDI implementation because it’s engineered to take full advantage of the build time optimization within Quarkus,
enabling supersonic runtime startup and subatomic memory utilization.
The slight drawback is that not all CDI features are available,
but features that developers generally use on a day-to-day basis are present.
Check out https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference for the details.

Reaching MicroProfile compatibility with Quarkus has been a milestone we’ve been seeking for a while now,
including full native compilation support with GraalVM,
which makes it even more fantastic to reach that point with the 1.0 release!
The team is eager to get back to bringing new innovations into SmallRye for Quarkus to utilize,
which may result in new MicroProfile specification proposals in the future.

Stay tuned for future updates on what we’re doing.
