synopsis: "Moving to Quarkus from a large SpringBoot ecosystem seemed overwhelming at first, but in the end, it was a simple straight-forward transition. Quarkus not only made Java development fun again but also drastically improved the developer experience and Logicdrop's ability to deliver features faster."
