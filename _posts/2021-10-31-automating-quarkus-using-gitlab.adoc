= Automating Quarkus Development with GitLab

image::logicdrop.png[Logicdrop logo,align="center"]

https://logicdrop.com[Logicdrop^] provides a business automation and data intelligence platform that enables enterprises to design their own solutions and run them in the cloud. We process millions of transactions a month across a global client-base and add significant value to mission-critical processes.  

== The Challenge
Coming from a spring boot background with multiple microservices, we had what was a pretty standard practice: Each application had it's own codebase and a copy/paste copy of a basic gitlab-ci.  Each application would live and die on it's own throughout the entire build/test/deploy process.  Granted, the gitlab-ci script was templated, but overall, each application was different enough that it couldn't be a complete copy.  Each production deploy would update the version so ordering the projects was important: Child deploys had to wait until the parent was done since the dependencies would update and that led us to only being able to deploy a single application at a time.

This took time for each full build.  Application A would be updated, tests would be run, deploy created and released, then application B would be updated with a new version for application A, tests run for application B, deploy created.....  On a good day, it would take a couple hours to go through all application waiting for the build to complete and released.  Most of this was waiting for tests to run or the release to be created which meant it was multiple 5-10 minute long waits before the next step.  There was no one button press to do everything.  Additional was the concern that a change to application A didn't break application E down the chain.

== GitLab Setup
The setup we settled on for everything was to split services, cluster operations, and templates into individual projects.  This allows us to easily introduce changes to existing configurations or apply new ones with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.

The _cluster_ project consolidates our cluster operations by centralizing anything that touches the kubernetes cluster into a single application. Each Quarkus service uses downstream triggers to notify the cluster project when something needs to be deployed or cleaned up.  

It is configured as a GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/management_project_template.html[cluster-management^] project to manage standard cluster applications like elastic, Nginx, or Jaeger, and any additional custom Helm charts.

image::gitlab/cluster-project.png[GitLab Cluster Project,align="center",width="292"]

The _templates_ project contains the various building blocks used by all GitLab jobs which allows easy maintainence and flexability.  Each Quarkus service reuses these templates resulting the Gitlab-ci scripts being very small.

=== Quarkus Services
Why Quarkus? Using Quarkus elminates using Helm charts to build the Kubernetes configuration. Each service is capable of creating its own manifests using the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[Quarkus Kubernetes^] and https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-config[Quarkus Kubernetes Config^] extensions.

TIP: Watch the service name carefully if you care overriding the Quarkus template.  It must match exactly or it will cause duplicates.

The _Platform_ project below is an example Mono Repository. All of its services are contained under a `services` folder but the pipelines treat each of them as if they were a unique project.

== Quarkus Extensions
Using out-of-box Quarkus extensions has made it easy and straight-forward to centralize the most common needs of developers in one place. 

Leveraging Quarkus extensions and integrating them into GitLab has:

- Saved time
- Increased visibility
- Fostered collaboration
- Reduced complexity

Two of the most important extensions we use are the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[Quarkus Kubernetes^] and https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-config[Quarkus Kubernetes Config^] extensions. 

Other useful extensions we integrate with GitLab are:

- https://quarkus.io/guides/tests-with-coverage[Quarkus Jacoco Extension^] which provides coverage https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#add-test-coverage-results-to-a-merge-request[results^] and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/test_coverage_visualization.html[reports^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/logging-sentry[Quarkus Logging Sentry Extension^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html[GitLab Error Tracking^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-health[Quarkus SmallRye Health^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/metrics/[GitLab Metrics^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui[Quarkus SmallRye OpenAPI Extension^] exposes https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/openapi/openapi_interactive.html[Swagger^] from within GitLab
- https://quarkus.io/guides/opentracing[Quarkus SmallRye OpenTracing Extension^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/tracing.html[GitLab Tracing^]

TIP: Quarkus extensions are what make the whole process so powerful. Individually, they are easy enough to setup and add value to each service but, when made an integral part of an automated process, their simplicity and flexibility really start to shine.  Similar to the DevPanel, you can weave extensions together and get a complete picture of your environment: all phases from development to deployment and beyond.

== Dreaming of Pipelines

=== Developer Powered Deployments
In rethinking our development process from the ground-up for a cloud-native world we wanted to simplify the developer/deploy process. 

Previously, deployments to higher environments was tedious but doable by our Ops team on request. Developers were not involved in this process. Since moving to Quarkus, developers are now responsible for developing and deploying (limitations apply). 

Using GitLab, we focused on using https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.html[merge requests pipelines^] as the catalyst to drive our development process.

image::gitlab/merge-request.png[Merge Request,align="center"]

Within every merge request we:

- Run all the unit tests
- Run integration tests (Mongo, Redis)
- Run E2E tests (AWS, external services)
- Generate code coverage and quality reports
- Provide live interaction with that branch's Swagger API

From the merge request developers can deploy one or more services. This lets developers do deployments ranging from a single spot-test to a full set of services.

image::gitlab/develop-pipeline.png[Review Pipeline,align="center"]

TIP: Lighter than a feather, Quarkus Native Builds are 1/10th the size of their comparable pure Java counterparts. This allows us to deploy a full cluster, if needed, per branch in the space it would typically take to deploy a single Spring-Boot application.

Two important parts of our pipeline are the downstream jobs that handle Quarkus services and then deploy them.

=== Building Quarkus Services
The downstream Quarkus build is a unique pipeline specific to building, testing, and containerizing (only) just Quarkus services. 

For each changed service we:

- Build the executable - native or FastJar
- Run any tests
- Generate Kubernetes manifests
- Build and deploy its container

image::gitlab/develop-downstream.png[Service Downstream Service,align="center"]

Once a container has been built and the manifests uploaded, the deploy package can be referenced anytime (or we can rollback to any previous version if needed).

TIP: We _only_ push the container and upload the manifests to AWS S3. This lets us accumulate, over time if needed, any changes into a single package that can be further configured during deployment. 

=== Faster Faster Pipelines
To speed up the pipelines, especially when building multiple native services, we use GitLab AutoScaling runners and run the jobs in parallel.  This allows us to build any number of services in a relatively constant time frame of about 10-15 minutes.

We use the GitLab `needs` keyword to short-circuit pipelines so that we can get to more important jobs quicker.  This allows us to immediately, and repeatedly if needed, deploy services as they are ready instead of having to wait for other jobs to finish.

image::gitlab/develop-dag.png[Review DAG,align="center"]

In the above https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/directed_acyclic_graph/[DAG^], anytime any service is ready we can deploy it without having to wait for other jobs.

TIP: Native builds are intensive, it is best to run them in parallel. Mileage may vary but We found AWS M5.XL instances to be the best value for our money when building native services.

== One Deploy to Rule Them All
Where a branch drives the development process, a tag drives the release process. 

At any given time the default branch can be promoted with a single click. This initiates a series of jobs that eventually _deploy only updated services into our staging cluster without manual intervention_.

image::gitlab/promotion.png[Promoting a Release,align="center"]

Clicking `promote` starts out by performing these steps:

- Reconcile Maven versions
- Update the changelog
- Create the release tag
- Build service(s) and deploy the containers
- Generate the Kubernetes manifests
- Publish Swagger API and generate OpenAPI clients
- Bumping the version to the next version

TIP: For better or worse, we do use https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html[Maven CI Friendly^] versions to help us simplify our versioning and deployment.

image::gitlab/release-pipeline.png[Deploy to Staging,align="center"]

Once the release package is ready, the downstream cluster job is triggered automatically.

image::gitlab/deployment.png[Single Deployment,align="center"]

The cluster job pulls down the generated manifests, performs any environment specific configurations, then finally deploys the service(s) to an environment.

image::gitlab/cluster-downstream.png[Cluster Downstream Service,align="center"]

You can see the transition from a merge request, to being merged, and then finally being released below.

image::gitlab/transition.png[Transitions of Pipelines,align="center"]

TIP: Currently, for 20+ services, we can perform complete end-to-end deployments, including native builds, in easily less than 30 minutes without any manual intervention. Most of the time we are only deploying changed services and the net time is far less.

== Git Your Quarkus Features
By tightly integrating our GitLab process with our Quarkus platform, our process has been trimmed down and it provides a one-stop shop for tools, logs, and monitoring. The most significant benefit is that everything can be accessed right from GitLab...

Teams can use GitLab first instead of having to interact with different external tools and applications (except in advanced scenarios).

=== Interactive API Endpoints
Swagger can be viewed and interacted with directly in GitLab. This allows for quick and easy spot testing during development or validating endpoints post-deployment.

image::gitlab/swagger.png[Swagger API,align="center"]

=== Errors and Warnings
Sentry is hooked into each project so that specific errors and warnings can be found quickly and easily without having to dig through logs. GitLab can even create or resolve tickets directly from the Sentry issue.  

image::gitlab/view-sentry.png[Sentry Errors,align="center"]

=== Coverage and Quality Reports
Jacoco generates coverage reports for each project and all the services within it. Metrics are maintained and visible throughout the lifetime of each service.

image::gitlab/coverage.png[Coverage Report,align="center"]

Additionally, Code Climate is used to measure changes in quality between the default branch and each merge request throughout the lifetime of every service.

=== Distributed Service Traces
Jaeger provides us with insights into how our APIs are used and lets us trace interactions between multiple services.

image::gitlab/view-jaeger1.png[Jaeger Query,align="center"]
image::gitlab/view-jaeger2.png[Jaeger Details,align="center"]

This is especially important in our platform because we heavily rely on single-responsibility services that communicate with other services.

=== Pod Health
Pod health can be monitored, per environment, by adding a couple of GitLab-specific annotations to the Quarkus generated Kubernetes manifests. This also shows us what pods are alive at any given time.

image::gitlab/view-pods.png[Pod Health,align="center"]

=== Cluster Logs
Kubernetes logs can be viewed from GitLab, eliminating the need for access to the cluster by developers. 

Logs can be viewed per environment or filtered for specific pods.

image::gitlab/view-logs.png[Cluster Logs,align="center"]

=== Prometheus Metrics
Prometheus metrics are exposed using GitLab's monitoring and metrics. 

image::gitlab/prom.png[Prometheus Metrics,align="center"]

We even have the ability to hook in custom Granfana dashboards.
