= Automating Quarkus Development with GitLab

image::logicdrop.png[Logicdrop logo,align="center"]

https://logicdrop.com[Logicdrop^] provides a business automation and data intelligence platform that enables enterprises to design their own solutions and run them in the cloud. We process millions of transactions a month across a global client-base and add significant value to mission-critical processes.  

== The Challenge
Coming from a spring boot background with multiple microservices, we had what was a pretty standard practice: Each application had it's own codebase and a copy/paste copy of a basic gitlab-ci.  Each application would live and die on it's own throughout the entire build/test/deploy process.  Granted, the gitlab-ci script was templated, but overall, each application was different enough that it couldn't be a complete copy.  Each production deploy would update the version so ordering the projects was important: Child deploys had to wait until the parent was done since the dependencies would update and that led us to only being able to deploy a single application at a time.

This took time for each full build.  Application A would be updated, tests would be run, deploy created and released, then application B would be updated with a new version for application A, tests run for application B, deploy created.....  On a good day, it would take a couple hours to go through all application waiting for the build to complete and released.  Most of this was waiting for tests to run or the release to be created which meant it was multiple 5-10 minute long waits before the next step.  There was no one button press to do everything.  Additional was the concern that a change to application A didn't break application E down the chain.

== GitLab Setup
The setup we settled on for everything was to split services, cluster operations, and templates into individual projects.  This allows us to easily introduce changes to existing configurations or apply new ones with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.

The _cluster_ project consolidates our cluster operations by centralizing anything that touches the kubernetes cluster into a single application. Each Quarkus service uses downstream triggers to notify the cluster project when something needs to be deployed or cleaned up.  

It is configured as a GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/management_project_template.html[cluster-management^] project to manage standard cluster applications like elastic, Nginx, or Jaeger, and any additional custom Helm charts.

image::gitlab/cluster-project.png[GitLab Cluster Project,align="center",width="292"]

The _templates_ project contains the various building blocks used by all GitLab jobs which allows easy maintainence and flexability.  Each Quarkus service reuses these templates resulting the Gitlab-ci scripts being very small.

=== Quarkus Services
Why Quarkus? Using Quarkus elminates using Helm charts to build the Kubernetes configuration. Each service is capable of creating its own manifests using the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[Quarkus Kubernetes^] and https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-config[Quarkus Kubernetes Config^] extensions.

TIP: Watch the service name carefully if you care overriding the Quarkus template.  It must match exactly or it will cause duplicates.

The _Platform_ project below is an example Mono Repository. All of its services are contained under a `services` folder but the pipelines treat each of them as if they were a unique project.

== Quarkus Extensions
Using out-of-box https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus extensions^] has made it easy and straight-forward to centralize the most common needs of developers in one place. 

Leveraging the extensions _and_ integrating them into GitLab has:

- Saved time
- Increased visibility
- Fostered collaboration
- Reduced complexity

Two of the most important extensions we use are the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[Quarkus Kubernetes^] and https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-config[Quarkus Kubernetes Config^] extensions. 

TIP: We found using https://quarkus.io/guides/config-yaml#profiles[Quarkus profiles^] and abstracting common release and Kubernetes properties into a shared JAR shielded developers even more from having to manage individual configurations.

The extensions we integrate into GitLab are:

- https://quarkus.io/guides/tests-with-coverage[Quarkus Jacoco^] for coverage https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#add-test-coverage-results-to-a-merge-request[results^] and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/test_coverage_visualization.html[reports^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/logging-sentry[Quarkus Logging Sentry^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html[GitLab Error Tracking^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-health[Quarkus SmallRye Health^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/metrics/[GitLab Metrics^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui[Quarkus SmallRye OpenAPI^] exposes the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/openapi/openapi_interactive.html[Swagger API^]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/opentracing[Quarkus SmallRye OpenTracing^] hooks into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/tracing.html[GitLab Tracing^]

TIP: Quarkus extensions are what make the whole process so powerful. They are easy enough to setup and add value by themselves but, when made an integral part of the developer experience, their simplicity and flexibility really start to shine. We found by weaving extensions together we can get a complete picture of our environment, from development to deployment and beyond, and it has made developing and debugging microservices easier.

== Dreaming of Pipelines

=== Developer Powered Deployments
In rethinking our development process from the ground-up for a cloud-native world we wanted to simplify the developer/deploy process. 

TIP: Previously, deployments to higher environments was tedious but doable by our Ops team on request. Developers were not involved in this process. Since moving to Quarkus, developers are now responsible for developing _and_ deploying (limitations apply). 

Using GitLab, we used https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.html[merge requests pipelines^] as the catalyst to drive our development process.

image::gitlab/merge-request.png[Merge Request,align="center"]

On every push, a merge request will:

- Run all the unit tests
- Run any integration tests (Mongo, AWS, Redis)
- Run any E2E tests (other external services)
- Generate code coverage and quality reports
- Publish an interactive Swagger API

The most useful feature of the merge request is developers can deploy any number of services, that can interacted with, into an isolated environment.

image::gitlab/develop-pipeline.png[Review Pipeline,align="center"]

Being able to deploy _preview_ services lets developers go beyond automated testing. They can spot-test services they are working on or even run a full suite of services if needed (this is especially useful during a combined UX and service feature).

TIP: Lighter than a feather, Quarkus native images are 1/10th the size of their comparable pure Java counterparts. This allows us to deploy a full set of services, if needed, in the space it would typically take to deploy the equivalent Spring-Boot services.

=== Building Quarkus Services
The downstream Quarkus build is a specialized pipeline specific to building, testing, and containerizing (only) Quarkus services. 

For each changed service we:

- Build the executable - native or FastJar
- Run the tests (including native ones if needed)
- Generate the Kubernetes manifests
- Build and deploy its container

image::gitlab/develop-downstream.png[Service Downstream Service,align="center"]

Once a container has been built and the manifests uploaded, the deploy package can be referenced anytime (or we can rollback to any previous version if needed).

TIP: We _only_ push the container and upload the manifests to AWS S3. This lets us accumulate, over time if needed, all changes into a single package that will be further augmented right before deployment. 

=== Faster Faster Pipelines
To speed up the pipelines, especially when building multiple native services, we use GitLab AutoScaling runners to run the jobs in parallel.  This allows us to build any number of services in a relatively constant time frame.

TIP: Currently, for 20+ services, we can perform complete end-to-end deployments, including native builds, in less than 20 minutes without manual intervention. Most of the time we are only deploying changed services so the net time is far less.

We use the GitLab's https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needs[`needs`^] keyword to short-circuit pipelines so that we can get to more important jobs quicker.  This allows us to immediately, and repeatedly if needed, deploy services as they are ready instead of having to wait for other jobs to finish.

image::gitlab/develop-dag.png[Review DAG,align="center"]

In the above https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/directed_acyclic_graph/[DAG^], as soon as a service is ready we can deploy it without having to wait for other jobs.

TIP: Native builds are intensive, it is best to run them in parallel. Mileage may vary but we found AWS M5.XL instances to be the best value for our money when doing this.

== One Deploy to Rule Them All
Where a branch drives the development process, a tag drives the release process. 

At any given time the default branch can be promoted with a single click. This initiates a series of jobs that eventually _deploy only the updated services into our cluster without manual intervention_.

What makes this so phenomenal, is that unless a test fails (which should of be caught before-hand based on our process), the whole promotion to deployment, whether it comes from a developer branch or the default branch is _fully automated_.

image::gitlab/promotion.png[Promoting a Release,align="center"]

Clicking `promote` starts out by performing these steps:

- Reconcile Maven versions
- Update the changelog
- Create the release tag
- Build service(s) and deploy the containers
- Generate the Kubernetes manifests
- Publish Swagger API and generate OpenAPI clients
- Bumping the version to the next version

TIP: For better or worse, we do use https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html[Maven CI Friendly^] versions to help us simplify our versioning and deployment.

Here we see the multiple jobs all running at the same time, including every Quarkus service pipeline in the project.

image::gitlab/release-pipeline.png[Deploy to Staging,align="center"]

Once the service builds are completed, the deployment to the next environment begins automatically.

image::gitlab/deployment.png[Single Deployment,align="center"]

The triggered downstream cluster job pulls down the generated manifests, performs any environment specific configurations, then finally deploys the service(s).

You can see the transition from a merge request, to being merged, and then finally being released below.

== Git Your Quarkus Features
By tightly integrating our GitLab process with our Quarkus platform, our process has been trimmed down and it provides a one-stop shop for tools, logs, and monitoring. The most significant benefit is that everything can be accessed right from GitLab...

Teams can use GitLab first instead of having to interact with different external tools and applications (except in advanced scenarios).

=== Interactive API Endpoints
Swagger can be viewed and interacted with directly in GitLab. This allows for quick and easy spot testing during development or validating endpoints post-deployment.

image::gitlab/swagger.png[Swagger API,align="center"]

=== Errors and Warnings
Sentry is hooked into each project so that specific errors and warnings can be found quickly and easily without having to dig through logs. GitLab can even create or resolve tickets directly from the Sentry issue.  

image::gitlab/view-sentry.png[Sentry Errors,align="center"]

=== Coverage and Quality Reports
Jacoco generates coverage reports for each project and all the services within it. Metrics are maintained and visible throughout the lifetime of each service.

image::gitlab/coverage.png[Coverage Report,align="center"]

Additionally, Code Climate is used to measure changes in quality between the default branch and each merge request throughout the lifetime of every service.

=== Distributed Service Traces
Jaeger provides us with insights into how our APIs are used and lets us trace interactions between multiple services.

image::gitlab/view-jaeger1.png[Jaeger Query,align="center"]
image::gitlab/view-jaeger2.png[Jaeger Details,align="center"]

This is especially important in our platform because we heavily rely on single-responsibility services that communicate with other services.

=== Pod Health
Pod health can be monitored, per environment, by adding a couple of GitLab-specific annotations to the Quarkus generated Kubernetes manifests. This also shows us what pods are active at any given time.

image::gitlab/view-pods.png[Pod Health,align="center"]

=== Cluster Logs
Kubernetes logs can be viewed right from GitLab, eliminating the need for access to the cluster by developers. 

Logs can be viewed per environment or filtered for specific pods.

image::gitlab/view-logs.png[Cluster Logs,align="center"]

=== Prometheus Metrics
Prometheus metrics are exposed using GitLab's monitoring and metrics.

== Conclusion
Integrating Quarkus deeply into GitLab has added significant value and was well worth the minimal effort it took. 

Building upon our _level the playing field_ philosophy, developing, debugging, deploying, and monitoring a large cloud-native platform is now more streamlined than ever.

Because of the natural fit Quarkus has with cloud technologies, and the functionality provided through extensions, we have been able to create a full DevOps ecosystem that normally would be challenging to setup and orchestrate.

Some of the highlights are:

- Developers can work with services in isolation
- Configurations are fully automated
- Parallizing builds decreased the time to deliver changes
- Deployments are completely automated
- Common tools are made available within GitLab

At the end of the day, we do not have to train staff in different tools, grant access any further then GitLab, or expose any infrastructure directly. 

Most of the functionality we need, at least initially, is accessible from one place - this lets us iterate, collaborate, and react quicker.
