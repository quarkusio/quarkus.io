title: "Using GitLab to Automate Quarkus Processes"
date: 2021-10-23
tags: user-story, development-tips, gitlab
synopsis: "Embracing Quarkus has changed how our developers work and existing processes, especially CI/CD, were re-architected as well to provide a smoother developer experience. Using GitLab, automated workflows now play a crucial role in every step of our pipeline. From inception, through development, and finally deployment, everything is managed with as little friction and as much visibility as possible."

= Using GitLab to Automate Quarkus Processes

image::logicdrop.png[Logicdrop logo,align="center"]

https://logicdrop.com[Logicdrop^] provides a business automation and data intelligence platform that enables enterprises to design their own solutions and run them in the cloud. We process millions of transactions a month across a global client-base and add significant value to mission-critical processes.  


== The Challenge

== Environment
Talk a little about how we can use a mono or per-repo service approach and why.

== Review Environments
Talk about MR and how they create isolated environments

What gets included:
- functional tests 
- integration tests (mongo, redis)
- e2e tests (aws, external providers)
- coverage
- jacoco (the quarkus extension)
- swagger

== Releasing Services
Talk about how an MR is merged, releases are automatically created, and deployment to staging happens in one step.

Talk about how we maintain the "manifests" in S3 to allow for easier management of the cluster across multiple services, not always in a single project.

Talk about the release process which creates the tag, changelog.

== Centralized Cluster
How we manage all the cluster "operations" not the manifests in a single project.

== Monitoring
Talk about integrations that keep everything in one place - logs, tracing, sentry.  All without having to leave GL.

Also worthwhile to show the "GL" metrics recorded.

== Conclusion
