synopsis: "Embracing Quarkus has changed how our developers work and existing processes, especially CI/CD, were re-architected as well to provide a smoother developer experience. Using GitLab, automated workflows now play a crucial role in every step of our pipeline. From inception, through development, and finally deployment, everything is managed with as little friction and as much visibility as possible."
