== What's new?

=== Hibernate Search standalone POJO Mapper

Hibernate Search has been part of the Quarkus ecosystem for a long time but until now we only supported the Hibernate ORM integration.

Quarkus 3.10 adds a brand new extension to add support for the Hibernate Search standalone POJO Mapper,
which allows to index directly arbitrary POJOs.

If you want to index structured data coming from files, MongoDB entities, ... this new extension should make you happy.

Interested in this extension? We have a https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-search-standalone-elasticsearch[dedicated guide] for you,
which covers the Quarkus integration and the basics.

For more advanced information about the Hibernate Search standalone POJO mapper,
please consult the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-pojo-standalone[Hibernate Search reference documentation] and the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/getting-started/standalone/en-US/html_single/index.html#mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started[Getting started] guide.

=== Flyway 10

We are a bit late to the party as we encountered some incompatibility with native executables and the new Flyway 10 but Quarkus 3.10 comes with an upgrade to Flyway 10, more precisely 10.10.

If you are not using `quarkus update`,
have a look at the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.10[migration guide] as they split some more database supports out of Flyway core.

=== Changes to `quarkus.package.*` config

The `quarkus.package.*` config was refactored.

The configuration changes are handled by `quarkus update` but if you are upgrading manually, have a closer look at the dedicated section of the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.10#packaging-configuration-gear-white_check_mark[migration guide].

Note that when using the previous configuration properties are deprecated but should still work
so you don't have to upgrade right away.
They will be dropped in a (relatively distant) future version.

=== Security enhancements

This new version comes with several improvements related to security:

* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/36504[#36504] - Allow authentication mechanism selection for a REST endpoint with annotation
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/37816[#37816] - Optional support for the OIDC session cookie dir encryption
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39793[#39793] - Support for verifying OIDC JWT claims with custom Jose4j `Validator`
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39812[#39812] - Support resolving of static OIDC tenants based on token issuers
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40056[#40056] - Add OIDC TokenCertificateValidator
