Today, we released Quarkus 3.9.2, our first (we skipped 3.9.0) maintenance release for the 3.9 release train.

This release contains bugfixes and documentation improvements.

It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using 3.9.

== Update

To update to Quarkus 3.9, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:

[source,bash]

quarkus update

Note that `quarkus update` can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.9.

If you are not already using 3.x, please refer to the https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-0-final-released/[3.0 announcement] for all the details.
