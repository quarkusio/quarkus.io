synopsis: Moving to Quarkus from a large SpringBoot ecosystem seemed overwhelming at first, but in the end, it was a simple straight-forward transition. Quarkus has not only made Java development fun again but also drastically improved the overall developer experience and our ability to deliver features faster.

= How Quarkus Improved Our Developer Experience and Process

Logicdrop provides a cloud-hosted rules and data analytics platform, that empowers business users with the tools required for building and delivering rules to upstream systems without technical intervention. On any given month, we process over 1M+ transactions.

At Logicdrop, we **__make the complex simple__** for our users so, how can we do the same for our own developers and process?

The developer experience plays as important a role in the process as the product itself. Being able to go from inception to delivery, quickly and confidently, fosters innovation and delivers world-class results. 

While everyone focuses on changing the world, we will focus on changing ourselves first. 

...this starts with our adoption of Quarkus.

== The Challenge

Development of our platform started almost 3 years ago. Quarkus was barely a rumbling, Kogito wasn't even a thing yet, and I managed to slip in the middle name Jenkins for my 2nd born because it was still a popular build system. 

Enter 2020, we were still using Spring Boot but fully embracing Kubernetes and other technologies like Knative, Kamel, and Ignite, to mention a few.  With these great advancements in our platform, and the features they enabled, came great complexity.

When we first started our technology teams were capable of wearing many hats but as the complexity gream so did the divide between front-end, back-end, and operations. Our process went from being very agile to sort of agile to waterfall and we had to carefully plan everything.

This process worked but somewhere we lost our way and we needed to evaluate ourselves from within.  How do we go back to being as nimble and innovative as before while not comprimising quality and deliverability? 

Well, we did what any self-respecting computer scientist would do and looked at the data. What was the average velocity, how long did it take to go from a ticket to the first push, how many sprints did we accomplish fully, how long does it take to deploy, where are our bottlenecks, and finally what do the developers say.

These top three pain points we decided to focus on were:

* It's too hard to setup the environment, locally or the cluster
* The learning curve was far more intensive than expected
* The CI/CD process was automated only within each service

It's now 2021 and our goal is not just to get back to status quo, it's to do things better and become cloud-native!

== WTF is Quarkus?

As stated on their website, it is pure *developer joy* and Quarkus has completely changed how we do things. Our biggest regret is not making the jump sooner.

We looked at many different stacks, Spring Boot, Micronaut, hec' even Guice was a consideration, and of course, Quarkus. We even considered other alternatives such as Python or .NET Core.

At the end of the day, Quarkus won us over because it is the Java we all know and love, but on steriods when needed, and it:

* Was the easiest to get productive in quickly
* Was the most cohesive ecosystem for our needs
* Could be reactive or imperative naturally
* Treated Kubernetes as a 1st class citizen

As we progressed with our MVP we really began to appeciate other aspects of Quarkus such as: 

* Docs simple enough to get started but also applicable to real-world tasks
* A community that was super responsive and helpful, especially the core developers

Native images was the one feature we were least concerned with initially but guess what? They worked great. We now deploy containers that are ~50MB down from 200MB. That not only goes a long way for cluster density but it also is saving us a ton of money on nodes.

At this point we decided if we were going to make this jump rather than retrofit our existing platform we would start from a clean slate. At the same time as we were building out a MVP we pushed the limit further and did a complete overhaul of everything! We redid our CI/CD process, cluster setup and management, and most importantly, the development culture.

Six months later and everything has been redesigned and rebuilt from the ground-up. 

Over 60% of our codebase has been migrated and it is less than half the size of the original codebase. We deploy numerous times an hour/day into preview and staging environments.

So, what did we accomplish moving to Quarkus?

* Onboarding __and__ ramp-up takes days instead of weeks
* The codebase is smaller, tighter and easier to understand
* Better tests, because it is easier to do, and higher code coverage
* Java is fun again with livecoding
* Immediate increased productivity

And, __all__ of our developers have enough working knowledge to build, test, and deploy services in hours not days or weeks.

Honestly, we had to learn Quarkus and redo __everything__ from scratch? Now, we are deploying production-ready code in less than six months?  That is pretty darn cool if you ask me.

== One Quarkus to Rule Them All

We started by consolidating different development environments into VSCode, everything can be done with Quarkus and VSCode.  Old approaches required heavy IDEs, scripts, multiple docker files, etc.  This begins the process of unifying the environment and teams.

Quarkus helped us to deploy locally, minikube, or cluster with ease.

== Teaching People to Fly

How quarkus standards, consolidated ecosystem, documentation helped to bring all developers on board

Point out pain of "AutoConfigure" and how Quarkus alleviated a good portion of useless code that was just there to wire up beans.

== Take the Helm (away)

How Quarkus removed the need to manage K8S services separately with Helm and another team.

== A Tale of Two Reproducers

Talk about reproducers and how community support responded.  Two in particular were important to us, good or bad, and the fact there was a response/fix in a day we felt confident going forward without it in the interim.

== Deploy Quarkus Deploy

How Quarkus simplified the CI/CD process to the point we could automate everything and include previews as well.

== Whatâ€™s Next

Kogito move
