= Building {project-name} apps with Gradle

== Gradle configuration

Configure Gradle as indicated in the link:gradle-config.html[Gradle configuration page].

At the moment there is no way of automatically generating a new project using the {project-name} Gradle plugin, 
luckily setting up a {project-name} project with Gradle is very simple. You only need to add the {project-name} Gradle plugin like this:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
apply plugin: 'io.quarkus.gradle.plugin'
----
Note: If you did not follow the steps indicated in the link:gradle-config.html[Gradle configuration page]
you need to add this block to your 'build.gradle' file as well:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'io.quarkus:quarkus-gradle-plugin:{quarkus-version}'
  }
}
----

[[project-creation]]
== Creating a new project

For now we have to manually create a Gradle project file for {project-name}. 
Here is a complete sample file for a simple rest project:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'maven'
apply plugin: 'io.quarkus.gradle.plugin' <1>


group = 'org.acme'
version = '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

buildscript { <2>
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'io.quarkus:quarkus-gradle-plugin:{quarkus-version}'
  }
}

repositories { <3>
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies { <4>
  compileOnly group: 'io.quarkus', name: 'quarkus-resteasy-deployment', version:'{quarkus-version}'
}
----

<1> The {project-name} plugin needs to be applied.
<2> The buildscript block can be omitted if you added it to your '~/.gradle/init.gradle' file.
<3> The repositories block can be omitted if you added it to your '~/.gradle/init.gradle' file.
<4> This dependency is needed for a rest application similar to the getting started example.


== Dealing with extensions

From inside a {project-name} project, you can obtain a list of the available extensions with:

[source]
gradle list-extensions

Functionality to automatically add extensions to your Gradle project is not implemented yet (coming soon).

== Development mode

{project-name} comes with a built-in development mode.
Run you application with:

[source]
gradle quarkus-dev

You can then update the application sources, resources and configurations.
The changes are automatically reflected in your running application.
This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.

`quarkus-dev` enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify 
your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
This works too for resource files like the configuration property file.
The act of refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the 
Java files are compiled, and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the 
redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the application.

== Debugging

You can run a {project-name} application in debug mode using:

[source]
gradle quarkus-dev --debug=true

Then, attach your debugger to `localhost:5005`.

== Import in your IDE

Once you have a <<project-creation, project generated>>, you can import it in your favorite IDE.
The only requirement is the ability to import a Gradle project.

**Eclipse**

In Eclipse, click on: `File -> Import`.
In the wizard, select: `Maven -> Existing Gradle Project`.
On the next screen, select the root location of the project.
The next screen list the found modules; select the generated project and click on `Finish`. Done!

In a separated terminal, run `gradle quarkus-dev`, and enjoy a highly productive environment.

**IntelliJ**

In IntelliJ:

1. From inside IntelliJ select `File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources...` or, if you are on the welcome dialog, select `Import project`.
2. Select the project root
3. Select `Import project from external model` and `Gradle`
4. Next a few times (review the different options if needed)
5. On the last screen click on Finish

In a separated terminal or in the embedded terminal, run `gradle quarkus-dev`. Enjoy!

**Apache Netbeans**

In Netbeans:

1. Select `File -> Open Project`
2. Select the project root
3. Click on `Open Project`

In a separated terminal or the embedded terminal, go to the project root and run `gradle quarkus-dev`. Enjoy!

**Visual Studio Code**

Open the project directory in VS Code. If you have installed the Java Extension Pack (grouping a set of Java extensions), the project is loaded as a Gradle project.

== Building a native image

Native images make {project-name} applications ideal for containers and serverless workloads.

Make sure to have `GRAALVM_HOME` configured and pointing to GraalVM version {graalvm-version}.

Create a native executable using: `gradle quarkus-native`.
A native executable will be present in `build/`.

=== Build a container friendly executable

The native executable will be specific to your operating system.
To create an executable that will run in a container, use the following:

[source,shell]
----
gradle quarkus-native --docker-build=true
----

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system 
it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a Docker container.
